### Hi, I'm Dena Surya Gumilah üëã

#### Educator turned Full-Stack AI & Web3 Developer

I'm an educator from Indonesia with a background in Informatics who is passionate about building technology that empowers people. My journey has led me to explore the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Web3**, where I focus on creating intelligent, decentralized applications from concept to deployment.

I thrive on solving complex problems and believe in the power of continuous learning. Below are my featured projects, all built from scratch.

## üöÄ Featured Projects

### üñºÔ∏è Java Nocturnals NFT Gallery (Full-Stack dApp)
- **Description:** This project delivers an end-to-end NFT collection of nine AI-generated artworks, each depicting Javanese nocturnal fauna in a distinctive Neon-Punk style. This project covers the entire Web3 development cycle, from digital asset creation and smart contract writing to building an interactive frontend dApp to display the on-chain assets.
- **Key Features:**
    - **Professional Smart Contract (ERC721):** Built with Solidity and OpenZeppelin, deployed on the Sepolia test network. Features include Ownable (only the owner can mint) and a mutable baseURI for metadata.
    - **Generative AI Assets:** The artwork was created with Leonardo AI, while the metadata (names & descriptions) was automatically generated using Python and the Google Gemini API.
    - **Interactive Frontend (dApp):** A gallery built with React & TypeScript that connects directly to the blockchain, capable of dynamically displaying the NFT collection by fetching data from the smart contract and IPFS.
    - **Decentralized Storage:** All NFT images and metadata are uploaded and served via IPFS (through Pinata) to ensure permanent data availability.
- **Tech Stack:** `Solidity`, `Hardhat`, `React`, `TypeScript`, `Ethers.js`, `IPFS`, `AI`

### üßë‚Äçüè´ Cipta Ajar AI
- **Description:** An intelligent web application designed as an AI assistant for educators in Indonesia. This project aims to drastically reduce teachers' administrative workload by automating the creation of complex, curriculum-compliant teaching materials.
- **Key Features:**
    - **Complete Teaching Material Generation:** Capable of generating 4 crucial types of documents: Teacher Enrichment Materials, structured Teaching Modules, Student Worksheets, and Question Banks.
    - **Dynamic & Customizable Input:** Users can customize the output in detail based on the educational level (Elementary, Junior High, High School/Vocational), grade, subject, topic, and even precise lesson hour allocations.
    - **Professional Interface:** Built with a clean UI/UX, featuring elegant notifications and practical features like "Copy Text" and "Download" for each document.
- **Tech Stack:** `Next.js`, `React`, `Tailwind CSS`, `Gemini API`
- **[‚û°Ô∏è LIVE DEMO ‚¨ÖÔ∏è](https://ciptaajar-denasurya.vercel.app/)**

### üó£Ô∏è VOCALITY - AI Voice Training
- **Description:** An interactive web application to improve English speaking skills using AI, tailored for junior high school students. This application uses a secure architecture where the Google Gemini API key is never exposed on the frontend. All AI requests are processed through a secure serverless function on Vercel.
- **Key Features:**
    - **Dual Practice Modes:** "Reading Practice" for fluency and "Image Description" for spontaneous speaking.
    - **Dynamic Content:** Practice texts and images are generated in real-time by the Google Gemini API.
    - **Comprehensive Assessment:** The AI provides a score and in-depth feedback on the user's voice recording, covering aspects like pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary.
    - **Audio Benchmark:** Users can listen to the correct pronunciation of the text at an adjustable speed, powered by the Web Speech API.
- **Tech Stack:** `HTML5`, `CSS3`, `JavaScript (ES6+)`, `Vercel Serverless Functions`, `Gemini API`, `MediaRecorder API`
- **[‚û°Ô∏è LIVE DEMO ‚¨ÖÔ∏è](https://vocaliti-final.vercel.app/)**
